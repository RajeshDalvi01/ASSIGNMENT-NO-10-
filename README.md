 RECOMMENDATION ENGINE/SYSTEM
It is a subclass of information filtering system that provide suggetions for items that one are most pertinent to a particular user. Information filteering system that seeks to predict the rating or the preferences a user might give toan item.

It is an algorithm that suggest relevant items to users.

types of Recommendation system : 1 - collabarative 2 - content based 3 - Demographic based 4 - Utility based 5 - knowledge based 6 - Hybrid Recommendation sys.

Recommendation system typically first produce an inventory of available content and then filter it in line with thier content moderation policies after which they pair the inventory down to only the item users are most likely to be
interested in.

Recommender systems are trained to understand the preferences, previous decisions, and characteristics of people and products using data gathered about their interactions. These include impressions, clicks, likes, and purchases. Because of their capability to predict consumer interests and desires on a highly personalized level, recommender systems are a favorite with content and product providers. They can drive consumers to just about any product or service that interests them, from books to videos to health classes to clothing.

How a recommender model makes recommendations will depend on the type of data you have. If you only have data about which interactions have occurred in the past, you’ll probably be interested in collaborative filtering. If you have data describing the user and items they have interacted with (e.g. a user’s age, the category of a restaurant’s cuisine, the average review for a movie), you can model the likelihood of a new interaction given these properties at the current moment by adding content and context filtering.

PAIRWISE DISTANCES:

This method takes either a vector array or a distance matrix, and returns a distance matrix. If the input is a vector array, the distances are computed. If the input is a distances matrix, it is returned instead. This method provides a safe way to take a distance matrix as input, while preserving compatibility with many other algorithms that take a vector array. If Y is given (default is None), then the returned matrix is the pairwise distance between the arrays from both X and Y.

COSINE SIMILARITY :

It meaure the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space .It is maseard by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines wheather two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction or not.
